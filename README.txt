This website provides navigation and information regarding a COVID 19 vaccine.

It can accessed via the link: https://riyadhultaher.github.io/covidappointments.github.io/

Alternatively, you can start by opening up the Index.html file in the html files folder.

There are three parts:

- The home screen has basic information regarding thee virus as well as a vaccine. There   
  is a button that allows a user to get started which brings them to the same location as  
  "Start" on the navigation drop down menu.

- The start screen allows users to create a username and password (this does not have any  
  actual functional purpose). The password must be at least 8 characters long, and
  contain an uppercase, lowercase, and special character. Submitting will take the user 
  to the confirmation page that includes information about the contributor.

- The contact screen gives an email for users to contact for support. They are also able
  to input their email address to be added to a listserv (this does not have any actual
  functional purpose). Submitting will take the user to the confirmation page that 
  includes information about the contributor.

Each site has its own drop down navigation menu (located in the top left) that allows a 
user to navigate through any part of the project regardless of where they currently are.
